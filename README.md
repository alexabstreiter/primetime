# Primetime
Tired of people showing up late to meetings? Use Primetime to get rewarded for being on time and let late showers pay for being late. Depending on the delay, their stake is distributed among all others.

## Installation:
Run the following commands to deploy the contract (you need enough MATIC tokens in your account):
```commandline
npm install
npm npm run compile
npm run full-deploy-custom-mumbai
```

Install the node packages and start the client:
```commandline
cd ./client
npm install
npm start
```

Please note that this client is for demonstration purposes only. Any app built on lens protocol can easily include our primetime collect module.
